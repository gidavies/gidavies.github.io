I'm an Azure Application Development Specialist, working for Microsoft in the UK. That means I cover areas such as DevOps, PaaS, Serverless and Containers (including Kubernetes).

Sometimes I find it useful to make a note of how to do something that isn't clearly covered in another location, and I'll use this blog as a place to put those things.

This is not an official Microsoft blog, just somewhere for me to make some notes and share them, if only to myself.
